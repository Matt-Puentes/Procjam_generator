2d Level generator(s)
Make several different methods for generating 2D levels + a simple AI to play those levels
Demonstrate which Level generation methods are best for certain aspects (simplicity, time requred, confusion).

Levels could be designed for:
  - Living spaces, similar to "Dwarf Fortress"
    - Could look at space distribution, how "clumped" rooms are, etc.
  - Being Maze-Like, similar to early doom maps
    - Generate keys + doors
    - Look for the AI taking a long time? look for cycles?
